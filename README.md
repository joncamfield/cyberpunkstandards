Technology Standards for a non-dystopian cyberpunk future

*See the [Cyberpunk Standards](https://joncamfield.com/blog/2019.02/cyberpunk-standards) blog post for context.*


### OWNERSHIP

* Restore and guarantee full ownership of purchased products to their purchasers - separate products from services, support and build open standards with limited licensing fees (only to ensure quality), and for hardware,  enable 3rd party repairs and user-replaceable components
* Support rollback of DMCA-like laws and aggressively support tinkering and reversing of owned products, leverage these as part of market research and ideation (e.g. iPhone rooting innovations brought app folders, new swipe-to-access control panels, and night-time modes)

## SUSTAINABILITY AND TRANSPARENCY

* Aim for long-term implementations and require backwards compatibility (e.g. don't be Apple)
* Open APIs and Standards: Embrace and support independent developers and open source tools by adopting and sticking with standards, providing extensive documentation, and directly supporting adaptations and independent projects instead of exporting the labor cost to volunteer developers.
* Open Source, code audits, and reproducible builds to prove the code audited is the code used, and improving the transparency and usability of this process all the way down -- including funding usability work to make this process clear and understandable.

### PRIVACY AND SECURITY

* Push data processing back to the edge - offline voice/image recognition and actions, focus on local-network applications which users can opt to bridge onto the Internet if they choose to
* Guarantee data portability, remove walled gardens, support open and stable APIs for personal use
* Minimization of data gathering; for debugging rely on user-initiated push and provide an understandable summary of what data is being submitted
* de-personalization of tracking, with audited and provable processes
* Evolving business models to support privacy and doubling down on the transparency aspects
* Use true end-to-end encryption wherever possible, and build a user experience around supporting that.
